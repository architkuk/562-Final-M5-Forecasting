# Walmart Time Series Forecasting
## Authors: Archit Kulkarni, Adhithya Narayanan, Tyler Youngberg, Vibhu Ambil

Using the Kaggle M5 Forecasting-Accuracy dataset, we have built forecast models using several algorithms, including:
* Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
* Long Short Term Memory
* Gradient Boosting Trees (via LightGBM)
* FB Prophet

The goal of the competition, as the title suggests, was to produce a forecast using the time series data given for 28 forecast days. Additional datasets for calendar and sale price were also provided, but have not yet been implemented into the program.
